# Dog API

* A simple project using html and JavaScript that contains an async function that returns a new div with all the breeds in the API endpoint, using an API call, to be listed in the HTML along with any subbreeds under each breed. This project was modified to also include another async function that returns a new div with each containing one random image of each breed and any subbreeds as well, which is imported into the original breeds.js file where both the breed and subbreed (if any) names and images are displayed in the html webpage using webpack.

## Special Thanks

* Cory Kane for suggesting this project and for guidance with making API calls.
